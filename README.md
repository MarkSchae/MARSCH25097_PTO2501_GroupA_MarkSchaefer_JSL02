## üß± Setup Instructions

Clone this repository or download the project files, including index.html, input.css, output.css, and tailwind.config.js.

### üì¶ Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm must be installed

You can check with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
Install node.js and Tailwind or use vanilla CSS. If you are using Tailwind, link the CDN or initialize a local version.

Open the folder in VS Code.

In the terminal (I use the Ubuntu terminal inside VS Code/your terminal of choice), make sure you're in the project directory:

cd into the folder directory or open the folder directly from VS Code
Run Tailwind's build process to generate output.css:
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
This should watch for changes and automatically recompile Tailwind CSS. If the watch is not working then remove it and rebuild manually.

Use the Live Server extension in VS Code to view the HTML file.

You should now see the Kanban board layout with styled columns and cards. The layout will automatically adjust for desktop or mobile views.
